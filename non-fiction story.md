## Our Universe

### _The Creation of the Universe_

Most astronomers think that the Universe was formed during an event called the Big Bang - a giant explosion which occurred between 10 and 20 billion years ago. During the Big Bang, all of the space, time, matter, and energy in the Universe was created. This giant explosion hurled matter in all directions and caused space itself to expand. As the Universe cooled, the material in it combined to form galaxies, stars, and planets.

### _How big is the Universe?_

Nobody really knows how big the Universe is because we cannot see to the edge of it. We don't even know if it has an edge. We can only see out to a distance of about 14 billion light years from Earth. This means that the size of the Universe that we can see is about 28 billion light years in diameter. However, the size of the Universe is changing and gets larger with time.

### _How many galaxies are there in the Universe?_

Astronomers think that there are at least several billion galaxies in the Universe. The exact number is not known. Galaxies are a system of millions or billions of stars, together with gas and dust, held together by gravitational attraction. We live in one of the galaxies, the Milky Way.

### _Did you know?_

1. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That’s at least a billion trillion!
2. The universe has no centre and is constantly expanding (getting bigger) every second – making it impossible to reach the edge.
3. A black hole is created when big stars explode. Its gravitational force is so strong that nothing can escape from it – luckily the closest black hole is about 10,000 light-years from Earth.
